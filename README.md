# Bolt for JavaScript Template App

This is a generic Bolt for JavaScript template app used to build out Slack apps.

## Setup

Before getting started, make sure you have a development workspace where you have permissions to install apps. If you don’t have one setup, go ahead and [create one](https://slack.com/create).

### Developer Program
Join the [Slack Developer Program](https://api.slack.com/developer-program) for exclusive access to sandbox environments for building and testing your apps, tooling, and resources created to help you build and grow.

## Installation

#### Create a Slack App
1. Open [https://api.slack.com/apps/new](https://api.slack.com/apps/new) and choose "From an app manifest"
2. Choose the workspace you want to install the application to
3. Copy the contents of [manifest.json](./manifest.json) into the text box that says `*Paste your manifest code here*` (within the JSON tab) and click *Next*
4. Review the configuration and click *Create*
5. Click *Install to Workspace* and *Allow* on the screen that follows. You'll then be redirected to the App Configuration dashboard.

#### Environment Variables
Before you can run the app, you'll need to store some environment variables.

1. Rename `.env.sample` to `.env`
2. Open your apps configuration page from [this list](https://api.slack.com/apps), click *OAuth & Permissions* in the left hand menu, then copy the *Bot User OAuth Token* into your `.env` file under `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`
3. Click *Basic Information* from the left hand menu and follow the steps in the *App-Level Tokens* section to create an app-level token with the `connections:write` scope. Copy that token into your `.env` as `SLACK_APP_TOKEN`.

### Setup Your Local Project
```zsh
# Clone this project onto your machine
git clone https://github.com/slack-samples/bolt-js-starter-template.git

# Change into this project directory
cd bolt-js-starter-template

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run Bolt server
npm start
```

#### Linting
```zsh
# Run lint for code formatting and linting
npm run lint
```

## Project Structure

### `manifest.json`

`manifest.json` is a configuration for Slack apps. With a manifest, you can create an app with a pre-defined configuration, or adjust the configuration of an existing app.

### `app.js`

`app.js` is the entry point for the application and is the file you'll run to start the server. This project aims to keep this file as thin as possible, primarily using it as a way to route inbound requests.

### `/listeners`

Every incoming request is routed to a "listener". Inside this directory, we group each listener based on the Slack Platform feature used, so `/listeners/shortcuts` handles incoming [Shortcuts](https://api.slack.com/interactivity/shortcuts) requests, `/listeners/views` handles [View submissions](https://api.slack.com/reference/interaction-payloads/views#view_submission) and so on.

## Heroku Deployment
Use the `Deploy to Heroku` button below to launch this app on Heroku. Ensure your Heroku config vars include the required Slack env variables.

## App Distribution / OAuth

Only implement OAuth if you plan to distribute your application across multiple workspaces. A separate `app-oauth.js` file can be found with relevant OAuth settings.

When using OAuth, Slack requires a public URL where it can send requests. In this template app, we've used [`ngrok`](https://ngrok.com/download). Checkout [this guide](https://ngrok.com/docs#getting-started-expose) for setting it up.

Start `ngrok` to access the app on an external network and create a redirect URL for OAuth. 

```
ngrok http 3000
```

This output should include a forwarding address for `http` and `https` (we'll use `https`). It should look something like the following:

```
Forwarding   https://3cb89939.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:3000
```

Navigate to **OAuth & Permissions** in your app configuration and click **Add a Redirect URL**. The redirect URL should be set to your `ngrok` forwarding address with the `slack/oauth_redirect` path appended. For example:

```
https://3cb89939.ngrok.io/slack/oauth_redirect
```

## Make This Template a Code Assistant App

Take your exploration a step further and make this template an [AI app](https://tools.slack.dev/bolt-js/concepts/ai-apps) with the use of a [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co) model. Follow [this tutorial](https://tools.slack.dev/bolt-js/tutorials/code-assistant) to find out how.
